# Milestone Project 1 Green Fields

## Fully functioning static HTML/CSS/Bootstrap website.

Keywords: github, pages, static website, coursework.

This project is for CodeInsititute's Milestone Project 1 for Full Stack Developer Course. Designed to showcase my understanding and learning of HTML and CSS code so far in this course.

Why did you build this project?
I chose to do a website about a fictional band called Green Fields as it allowed me to demonstrate a number of different elements and functions that I've learned so far in the course.

What it does?
This website is a simple example of how to create a static website using GitHub Pages. It includes two pages, namely a homepage and a contact.

How to use?
To use this website, you can simply visit the GitHub Pages website and enter the URL of the website. You can also clone the repository and host the website yourself.

## Features

- Working Modal with email link.
- Responsive Design
- Contact Form Page
- Bootstrap container framework.
